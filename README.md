# Dice-Defense

A fast paced side scrolling shooter where you get your stats based on the roll of the dice. Throughout the game you can roll the dice to change the enemy stats, which may make things easier or harder. Doing so at low HP may give you one HP back. Destroy 30 enemies to win the game!

## Running the game
Run using LÖVE (https://love2d.org/). Build binaries using makelove (https://github.com/pfirsich/makelove)

## How to play
Move with WASD. Shoot using [Space]. Roll dice using [Enter]. Dice can only be rolled after when the indicator in the upper right changes colors (and a sound effect is played). [Escape] will pause the game. A mouse is needed for interacting with UI elements.
